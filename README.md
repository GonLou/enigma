High performance solutions to New Scientist Enigma puzzles

These puzzles, published every week in New Scientist, often
make great programming challenges for interview questions
and students.

I have been setting these challenges as programming problems
but also as optimisation practice.

The best solution is one that runs in the least time, but covers
the entire search space of the problem.
